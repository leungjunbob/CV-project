## Description

A key application in computer vision is understanding physical relations between objects in the world.
For example, self-driving cars must be able to use visual and other sensor data to reason about the
location, speed, and trajectory of nearby objects in order to move safely on public streets. A robot
working in a home or factory setting may need to use vision to solve everyday physics problems, such
as how to pack items into boxes, how to place items onto shelves, or how to pick up and deposit items
without breaking them.
